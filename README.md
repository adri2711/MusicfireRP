# Getting the Resourcepack

If you just want to download it once, you can get it by going to Code > Download as Zip


If you want to be able to update it live as people add to it here's how:

1. Install Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

2. Clone the repository to your .minecraft\resourcepacks folder: Code > Open with Github Desktop > Clone
   IMPORTANT: the repository path should be .minecraft\resourcepacks\MusicfireRP (make sure there isn't an additional folder)

3. Once you've successfully cloned the repository, you can normally apply the resourcepack from Minecraft. To update it as people add things, click on fetch origin.

# Contributing to the Resourcepack

1. Get added to the repo - include your GitHub account in the signup or message @Asometric#2711.

2. Clone the repository (instructions above)

3. Before modifying anything, make a new branch and name it after your team.

4. Add your item textures to the folder inside of assets that matches your area. (For example, area 5 textures would go in MusicfireRP/assets/area_5). For anything that    isn't item textures, contact the organisers. Once you've added them, commit your changes and push to origin.

5. To submit your changes, create a pull request. A browser tab will open for it. Once you've created it, an organiser will review it and add it into the main branch of the pack.
