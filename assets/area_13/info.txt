# Contributing to the Resourcepack

1. Get added to the repo - include your GitHub account in the signup or message @Asometric#2711.

2. Clone the repo (If you're here you probably already did this!)

3. Before modifying anything, make a new branch (In Github Desktop: Branch > New Branch) and name it after your team.

4. Add your item textures to the folder inside of assets that matches your area. (For example, area 5 textures would go in MusicfireRP/assets/area_5).
   For anything that isn't item textures, contact the organisers. Once you've added them, commit your changes and push to origin.

5. To submit your changes, create a pull request (Branch > Create Pull Request). A browser tab will open for it. Once you've created it, an organiser will review it and add it into the main branch of the pack.
